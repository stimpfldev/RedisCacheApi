# ASP.NET Core API – Clean Architecture Demo

Small ASP.NET Core API to practice clean architecture ideas:

- ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- Entity Framework Core + SQL Server
- DTOs + AutoMapper
- Global error handling (middleware)
- Validation with DataAnnotations + ModelState
- Simple logging and basic filters
- Ready to extend with caching and Redis
